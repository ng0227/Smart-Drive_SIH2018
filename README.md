Smart India Hackathon 2018 project : Ministry of Road Transport & Highways

### Problem Statement
Identification of accident prone Spots by the road users and their reporting to the concerned Highway Authority.

### Solution
In todayâ€™s existing system hardware technology is used for accident alerts and even the technology is used in very less vehicles. The accident prone areas are not marked with the precise information of the cause of accidents. Commuters do not have the details of highway authorities on their finger tips and are unable to report problems and the causes of accidents.

Smart Drive s a smart phone application and a web portal which removes dependency on hardware and use readily available smart phones for solving this problem.

#### Key Features

##### 2. Automatic alert: 
SmartDrive app automatically generates accident alert without manual support hence will help user in fatal accident where user is unconscious or unable to alert app will automatically do it. App has a manual alert system in which user can generate an alert if meet an accident or report an accident, can also be done using web portal and an automatic alert system in which sensor of smart phone are used to generate accident alert if meet an accident with precise location of incident using text SMS if offline or online if internet available. In automatic alert alarm will ring for 2 min in which user can cancel the alert if no issue or let alert generated for rescue. From authority this location can be passed to nearest patrolling vehicle and also alert nearby road users to take safety measures.
