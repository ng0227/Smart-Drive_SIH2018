Smart India Hackathon 2018 project : Ministry of Road Transport & Highways

Problem Statement
Identification of accident prone Spots by the road users and their reporting to the concerned Highway Authority.

Solution
In todayâ€™s existing system hardware technology is used for accident alerts and even the technology is used in very less vehicles. The accident prone areas are not marked with the precise information of the cause of accidents. Commuters do not have the details of highway authorities on their finger tips and are unable to report problems and the causes of accidents.

Smart Drive s a smart phone application and a web portal which removes dependency on hardware and use readily available smart phones for solving this problem.
